- Instantiating Prisma Client for development purpose
- In dev. the command npm run clears Node.js cache on the run. This would exhuast DB connections as ech instant     
  hold's it's own pool
- Solution to this is to instantiate a single instance PrismaCilent and save it on the globalThis object. Then we 
  would keep a check to only instantiate PrismaClient if it's not on the globalThis object otherwise use the same 
  instance again
